## Reference Documentation

- **Storybook**: [Storybook Docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs)  
  For interactive component development, documentation, and testing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: [Tailwind Docs](http://tailwindcss.com/docs/)  
  For utility-first CSS classes and responsive design.
- **React**: [React Docs](https://react.dev/reference/react)

## UI & Animation Guidelines

- **Animation Speed**:
  - Keep UI animations fast (0.2sâ€“0.3s preferred, max 1s unless illustrative).
  - Use `ease-out` for most UI transitions.
- **Easing**:
  - Prefer custom cubic-bezier easings for complex transitions (see project rules).
  - Use built-in `ease` or `linear` only for simple hover transitions.
- **Performance**:
  - Animate `opacity` and `transform` for best performance.
  - Use `will-change` only for `transform`, `opacity`, `clipPath`, or `filter`.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for users who prefer less animation.
- **Hover Transitions**:
  - Use `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` to disable hover effects on touch devices.

## Component Structure

- Use clear, composable components (see `Input.Label`, `Input.Group`, etc.).
- Prefer passing `className` for style overrides.
- Use context for shared state (e.g., `useInputContext`).

## How to Use This File

- Reference the above documentation when implementing or reviewing code.
- Follow the UI and animation guidelines for a consistent, accessible user experience.
- When in doubt, consult the linked docs or ask for clarification in code review.
